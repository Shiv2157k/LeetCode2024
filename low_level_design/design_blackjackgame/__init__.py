"""
Design Pattern:
---------------
The Iterator design pattern can be applied,
    -----------------------
since cards are assigned to the players from the deck of cards
by just iterating through the list of cards.

We can also use the State design pattern for our online Blackjack game because
                    --------------------
this game has a finite number of states. Some of these states are as follows:
- Shuffle the deck
- Draw a card and give it to the dealer
- Draw a card and give it to the player
- Deal cards
- Player hit
- Player stand
